        Microsoft Visual Studio is an integrated development environment (IDE) from Microsoft. It is used to develop
        computer programs, as well as websites, web apps, web services and mobile apps. Visual Studio uses Microsoft
        software development platforms such as Windows API, Windows Forms, Windows Presentation Foundation, Windows
        Store and Microsoft Silverlight. It can produce both native code and managed code.

        Visual Studio includes a code editor supporting IntelliSense (the code completion component) as well as code
        refactoring.
